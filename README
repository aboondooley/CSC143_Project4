Comments: I enjoyed this assignment and I didn't think HashMap was as hard as I thought it would be.
That being said, the project still took me a very long time to implement! I think it was around 30 hours, it might be a little under or over.
I think it is important to understand how HashMap actually works underneath the hood as it is used a lot in other languages and in Java.
I am afraid that my iterator is costly though, and I would love feedback on how I implemented it!
